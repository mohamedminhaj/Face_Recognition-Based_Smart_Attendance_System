#📸 Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition
This project is a smart attendance system developed using Python and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for real-time face recognition.

✅ Features
🎯 Real-time face detection and recognition for student attendance

🗃️ Automatically marks attendance and stores it in CSV files

📊 Visualizes attendance data using a Streamlit dashboard

💻 Fully local system — no cloud dependencies

🎯 Objective
To build a lightweight, reliable, and efficient small-scale facial recognition model tailored for offline environments like classrooms or labs.
