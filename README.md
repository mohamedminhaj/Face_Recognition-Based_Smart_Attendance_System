## 📸 Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition

This project is a **real-time smart attendance system** designed to automate the process of recording student attendance using **facial recognition**. Built with **Python**, the system uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to identify students from webcam input and mark their presence automatically.

The application runs **completely offline**, making it ideal for **classrooms, computer labs, and small institutions** that prefer privacy-focused, low-cost solutions without relying on cloud services.

### ✅ Features

- 🎯 **Real-time Face Detection & Recognition**  
  Detects and recognizes students’ faces from a live webcam feed using face encodings.

- 🗃️ **Automated Attendance Logging**  
  Automatically records attendance into **CSV files** with the current date and time.

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)**  
  Displays attendance summaries, student data, and statistics through a **user-friendly dashboard**.

- 🔐 **Privacy-Preserving & Offline**  
  No internet connection required — ensures **student data security** and works in **low-resource environments**.

- 🧠 **Lightweight & Scalable Model**  
  Uses a simple yet effective KNN classifier suitable for small to medium-sized datasets without requiring heavy computation.

### 🎯 Project Objective

To develop a **cost-effective, secure, and efficient** facial recognition-based attendance solution that minimizes manual effort and errors. The focus is on:
- Enhancing attendance accuracy and speed  
- Reducing human dependency in daily attendance tasks  
- Providing a local-first system with no third-party service reliance  
- Offering a smooth and intuitive experience via a web-based interface (Streamlit)

### 💡 Tech Stack
- **Python** – core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – for real-time image capture and face detection  
- **face_recognition** – for generating and comparing facial encodings  
- **KNN (Scikit-learn)** – for face classification  
- **Streamlit** – for building the interactive dashboard  
- **CSV, Pandas** – for data storage and manipulation
